## My process

1. I divided the project into sections by the use of sass partials. Which made this project more organized;
2. used the sass functions to convert pixel values to rem.sass functions make things way easier;
3. created mixins to handle the various buttons on the page which keeps repeating itself at different sections. In this way i do not have to worry about creating a new button each and every time. I just need to import just one mixin.
4. I created this responsive project on mobile first. in this way things get way more easier as I scale/develop the project for desktop;
5. I used js regular expressions to validate the email;
6. I used flexbox and grid system design to create this project;
7. used only one JavaScript file for this project;

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learnt how to use the css min() and the clamp() functions to archieve greater responsiveness.

<!-- css and js syntax that i am glad I know. -->

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  font-size: clamp(14px, 17px + 2vw, )

}

```

```js
forEach((item)) = () => {
  item.addEventListener('click',()=> {
    console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
  })
}
```

### Continued development

1. Avoiding the use of muliple media query breakpoints
2. Accessibility[the use of ARIA attributes]
